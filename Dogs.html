        <P CLASS="QUOTES"><p> A world filled with so much stress, and worry we need something to look forward to at the end of the day. What better thing to look
             forward to than coming home to your dog? After all they can do just about anything to make us feel better.
            </p> <p>
            1. Protection.
            Dogs will lay with you and protect you when something is wrong. If you are sad, hurt, angry, etc. a dog can sense that and will do everything to love you
             and make you feel better. And even when it feels like everything is going wrong, when a dog nuzzles their little nose into you and continues to sit with 
             you, you can’t help but feel better.
            </p><p>
            2. Unconditional Love.
            Dogs only know how to love, but most importantly only know how to love unconditionally. Your dog does not care about your grades, your mistakes, your flaws.
             Your dog is going to always love you for you no matter what, and there really isn’t anything better than that.
            </p><p>
            3. Energy.
            After a long day of work, or school often we are run down, and worn out, but there is no better feeling than when your dog jumps up to greet you when you
             get home. For no matter the day you have had your dog will always bring energy into your life by wanting to play with you, and you are lying if you say 
             that isn’t the best thing ever.
            
            </p><p>
            4. Cuddle Buddies.
            Everyone wants to cuddle, but not everyone has a cuddle buddy. Grab your dog, not only are they the best but they love it too. Not to mention they are just 
            about the cutest things ever.
            
            Sometimes it is hard to believe these furry little friends can even exist. For they provide so much love and light in our lives and honestly bring out the
             good in us. We really do not deserve them, but lord am I thankful that we have them in our lives.<hr>

Pomeranian
   ​The Pomeranian combines a tiny body (no more than seven pounds) and a commanding big-dog demeanor. The abundant double coat, with its frill extending over the
    chest and shoulders, comes in almost two dozen colors, and various patterns and markings, but is most commonly seen in orange or red.
  
  Alert and intelligent, Pomeranians are easily trained and make fine watchdogs and perky pets for families with children old enough to know the difference 
  between a toy dog and a toy. Poms are active but can be exercised with indoor play and short walks, so they are content in both the city and suburbs.
   They will master tricks and games with ease, though their favorite activity is providing laughs and companionship to their special human.
